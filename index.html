                    <p>I'm sure you know what a chicken is—it's a common farm bird kept for its eggs and meat. Hens
                        lay
                        eggs, roosters crow, and they all love scratching the ground for food. Chickens live in
                        groups,
                        follow a pecking order, and make all sorts of clucking sounds to communicate. They're
                        simple,
                        social, and surprisingly smart! But have you ever taken a deeper dive into learning more
                        about
                        them?</p>

                    <p>This is a rooster — the male chicken known for its vibrant feathers and loud crowing.
                        Roosters
                        are often larger and more colorful than hens, with striking tail feathers and a prominent
                        comb
                        on their heads. They play an important role in protecting the flock, warning hens of danger,
                        and
                        establishing the pecking order through their behavior. Their crowing can be heard early in
                        the
                        morning, signaling the start of a new day.</p>

                        However, these chickens are considered <b>rare</b>. They are native to specific countries
                        and are often kept as pets rather than for farming, as some breeds are not very hardy and
                        may fall sick or die easily without proper care.

                        <p>Blatantly—yes. You can eat chicken! One of Singapore's signature dishes is Hainanese
                            Chicken Rice, and it's enjoyed by people all over the world! It's a well-known and
                            beloved delicacy.
                            On another note, we usually eat hens, not roosters. Why? Because rooster meat tends to
                            be tough and chewy. Roosters develop stronger muscles as they use them to fight for
                            territory and dominance. That makes their meat harder to cook and bite through.
                            But still, roosters aren't completely left out—they're often used in traditional Chinese
                            dishes like herbal chicken soup, rich chicken broth… and hey, maybe even chicken
                            nuggets. Quite yummy, honestly. But see... chicken on the right seems scared already!

            <p>So, about Singapore's chickens... why are there so many roaming around Singapore lately? While we
                don't
                usually think of chickens in an urban city, they're actually more common than you'd expect. Whether
                they're waking people up with a morning crow or just pecking around under a tree, chickens have
                quietly
                become part of Singapore's everyday landscape!</p>

                    <p>The issue of wild chickens came to the fore in 2017, when the Agri-Food and Veterinary
                        Authority
                        of Singapore (AVA) revealed that it put down 24 chickens that were wandering around Thomson
                        View
                        and Blocks 452 to 454 Sin Ming Avenue. There were about 20 complaints from residents there,
                        mainly about noise. <a

                        and chickens running amok. "We don't find them a nuisance," said housewife Eline Peh, who
                        moved
                        into the area late last year. "In fact, we will miss them if they are gone." Singaporeans
                        think
                        that the chickens give Singapore its identity, and enriches wildlife.</p>

                            cluck.
                        </li>

                        <li>The second sound is made by a baby chick. Baby chicks tend to produce high-pitched and
                            surprisingly loud sounds. Instead of clucking like an adult chicken, they <b>chirp</b>.
                        </li>

                        <li>Thirdly, we have the sound of an <b>angry hen</b>. Usually, hens are peaceful. However,
                            they
                            become aggressive when other animals steal their eggs or pose any danger to them. They
                            will
                            get defensive and try to scare the threat away.</li>

                        <li>Lastly, this sound is made by a rooster. Roosters usually <b>crow</b> at dawn to signal
                            the
                            start of a new day. While they are known for crowing in the morning, they also do it to
                            mark
                            their territory and show off their dominance!</li>

            </h2>
            <p>What makes chickens, one of the most basic and common animal that you have probably heard, so
                special?
                Well, they are actually more capable than you think! At first, they might seem like the regular
                typical
                garden bird. But after knowing these fun facts, it will make you reconsider!</p>

                        <li>Chickens love to play, run, skip and flap their wings. They also enjoy sunbathing.</li>
                        <li>Hens teach sounds to their chicks while they are still in the egg.</li>
                        <li>Chickens have a profound memory and are able to distinguish between more than 100 faces
                            of
                            their species. They can also recognise people.</li>
                        <li>Chickens are able to distinguish colours. They also see ultraviolet light and iridescent
                            hues. Their world looks more colourful than ours.</li>
                        <li>The cognitive skills of chickens are similarly high to those of a dog or cat.</li>

                    <h3 class="intro"><u>Can chickens fly?</u></h3>
                    <p>One of the most frequently asked questions is: Can chickens actually fly?
                        The answer is yes — but only for short distances!
                        You might wonder how they manage to fly at all, especially since their bodies are much
                        heavier
                        than those of other birds, like the common mynah or the dove.
                        This is because chickens have a unique wing structure that allows them to glide for a short
                        while. Their wings and bodies are covered in many feathers, which aid them in brief flight.
                        But feathers aren't just for flying — they also serve an important purpose in incubating
                        eggs.
                        Mother hens use their feathers to keep their eggs warm and safe.
                        And that's just one of the reasons why chickens are so cool.</p>

                    <h3 class="intro">Photography</h3>
                    <p>All the photographs were taken by me! There are a lot of chickens around the central areas of
                        Singapore — especially near Outram Park, Queenstown, and Redhill. Have you noticed the big
                        field just outside NYP? There are chickens there too!
                        This really shows that Singapore lives up to its name as a <b>"Garden City."</b> It's
                        amazing how both animals and humans can coexist so closely with nature. That's the beauty of
                        mother nature.</p>
